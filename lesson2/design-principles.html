            <p>Ark id's is a website used to pull console commands for a survial game called Ark: Survival Evolved. I chose this website for proximity because I feel this website is very well organized. It has equal spacing all around is pleasant to look at overall.

            <p>I chose IMDB for alignment because they keep all of their and titles aligned to the left of the screen. The text and titles are also in line with each other making the website pleasant to view and easy to read. </p>

            <picture><img src="images/github.jpg" alt="github_website"></picture>
            <p>I chose github for contrast because their major color scheme is white and black. I don't think you can get more contrast than that.</p>
